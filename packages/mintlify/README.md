### 🚀 Installation

Download the Mintlify CLI using the following command

```
npm i mintlify -g
```

### 👩‍💻 Development

Run the following command at the root of your Mintlify application to preview changes locally.

```
mintlify dev
```

Note - `mintlify dev` requires `yarn` and it's recommended you install it as a global installation. If you don't have yarn installed already run `npm install --global yarn` in your terminal.

#### Troubleshooting

Steps you can take if the dev CLI is not working (After each step try to run `mintlify dev` again):

- Make sure you are using Node v18 or higher.
- Run `mintlify install` to re-install dependencies.
- Navigate to the `.mintlify` folder in your home directory and delete its contents.
- If all else fails navigate to `~/.mintlify` and `git clone https://github.com/mintlify/mint.git --branch legacy-components-import`
